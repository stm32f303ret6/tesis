=== BEZIER GAIT PARAMETERS EXPLANATION ===

The gait cycle has TWO phases:

1. SWING PHASE (50% of cycle) - Foot in the air
   - Uses a cubic Bezier curve with 4 control points
   - Lifts the foot, moves it forward, then sets it down

2. STANCE PHASE (50% of cycle) - Foot on the ground
   - Linear motion from front to back
   - Simulates the body moving forward over the planted foot

PARAMETERS:

1. num_points (default: 100)
   - Total number of trajectory points in one complete gait cycle
   - Higher = smoother trajectory but more computation
   - 50 points for swing, 50 points for stance

2. step_length (default: 0.04m = 40mm)
   - How far forward/backward the foot travels
   - Horizontal distance from back position to front position
   - Larger value = longer stride
   - Range at step_length/2 to -step_length/2

3. step_height (default: 0.03m = 30mm)
   - Maximum height the foot lifts during swing
   - Measured from stance_height
   - Larger value = higher foot clearance over obstacles
   - Peak occurs near middle of swing phase

4. stance_height (default: -0.08m = -80mm)
   - Height of foot when on ground (negative = below base)
   - This sets the robot's body height
   - More negative = robot squats lower
   - Less negative = robot stands taller
   - Must be within IK reachable range!

BEZIER CONTROL POINTS (automatically calculated):

  P0: [-step_length/2, 0, stance_height]           ← Start: back, on ground
  P1: [-step_length/3, 0, stance_height + step_height]  ← Lift back
  P2: [+step_length/3, 0, stance_height + step_height]  ← High forward
  P3: [+step_length/2, 0, stance_height]           ← End: front, on ground

The Bezier curve creates a smooth arc from P0 → P3 influenced by P1 and P2.

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
  X: Forward/backward (positive = forward)
  Y: Lateral/sideways (0 for basic gait)
  Z: Vertical (negative = down from base, 0 = base level)

TYPICAL VALUES FOR YOUR ROBOT:
  - Max reach: L1 + L2 = 0.045 + 0.06 = 0.105m (105mm)
  - Safe stance_height range: -0.04 to -0.09m (-40mm to -90mm)
  - Safe step_length range: 0.02 to 0.06m (20mm to 60mm)
  - Safe step_height range: 0.01 to 0.05m (10mm to 50mm)
