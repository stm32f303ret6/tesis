in '/home/rsc/Desktop/repos/walk/height_control.py' '/home/rsc/Desktop/repos/walk/ik.py' '/home/rsc/Desktop/repos/walk/gait_controller.py' i already have implemented an IK + bezier curve gait controller for my quadruped robot that works fine in a flat ground '/home/rsc/Desktop/repos/walk/model/world.xml'

now i need to use gymnasium + stable baseline 3 PPO to train my robot to walk in a rough terrain '/home/rsc/Desktop/repos/walk/model/world_train.xml'

i was thinking to use Residual Learning that corrects the current existing trajectory, like final_foot_position = bezier_trajectory_position + ppo_residual
the robot  '/home/rsc/Desktop/repos/walk/model/robot.xml' already include sensors for state space

could you make a detailed plan in a markdown file?
