=== BEZIER GAIT PARAMETERS EXPLANATION ===

The gait cycle has TWO phases:

1. SWING PHASE (50% of cycle) - Foot in the air
   - Uses a cubic Bezier curve with 4 control points
   - Lifts the foot, moves it forward, then sets it down

2. STANCE PHASE (50% of cycle) - Foot on the ground
   - Linear motion from front to back
   - Simulates the body moving forward over the planted foot

PARAMETERS:

1. num_points (default: 100)
   - Total number of trajectory points in one complete gait cycle
   - Higher = smoother trajectory but more computation
   - 50 points for swing, 50 points for stance

2. step_length (default: 0.04m = 40mm)
   - How far forward/backward the foot travels
   - Horizontal distance from back position to front position
   - Larger value = longer stride
   - Range at step_length/2 to -step_length/2

3. step_height (default: 0.03m = 30mm)
   - Maximum height the foot lifts during swing
   - Measured relative to body_height (downward from base)
   - Larger value = higher foot clearance over obstacles
   - Peak occurs near middle of swing phase

4. body_height (default: 0.08m = 80mm)
   - Height of foot when on ground (positive = below base)
   - This sets the robot's body height
   - Larger value = robot squats lower
   - Smaller value = robot stands taller
   - Must be within IK reachable range!

BEZIER SWING TRAJECTORY:

  The swing phase is generated by a cubic Bézier curve constructed by the
  ``DiagonalGaitController`` using the ``bezier`` library. Control points are
  derived from (step_length, step_height, body_height, swing_shape) and
  produce a smooth arc from back (stance) → lifted mid-swing → front (stance).

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
  X: Forward/backward (positive = forward)
  Y: Lateral/sideways (0 for basic gait)
  Z: Vertical (positive = down from base, 0 = base level)

TYPICAL VALUES FOR YOUR ROBOT:
  - Max reach: L1 + L2 = 0.045 + 0.06 = 0.105m (105mm)
  - Safe body_height range: 0.04 to 0.09m (40mm to 90mm)
  - Safe step_length range: 0.02 to 0.06m (20mm to 60mm)
  - Safe step_height range: 0.01 to 0.05m (10mm to 50mm)
